The key components typically found in a network router are:

    Switching Fabric
      Responsible for forwarding packets between the different network interfaces
    
    Routing Engine
      Handles the routing protocols and maintains the routing table
      Makes decisions about the best path to forward packets
    
    Network Interfaces
      Physical ports (e.g., Ethernet, fiber) for connecting to different network segments
      Often includes at least two interfaces (internal and external)
    
    Network Address Translation (NAT)
      Translates between internal private IP addresses and external public IP addresses
    
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server
      Assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices
    
    Content Addressable Memory (CAM) Table
      Stores the mapping between MAC addresses and switch port locations
    
    Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Cache
      Stores the mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses
    
    Firewall
      Provides network security by filtering and controlling traffic flow
    
    Virtual Private Network (VPN) Server
      Enables secure remote connectivity to the network
    
    Quality of Service (QoS)
      Prioritizes and manages network traffic to ensure quality of service
    
    Wireless Access Point
      Provides wireless connectivity for devices
    
    DNS Caching
      Improves response times for DNS queries
    
    Load Balancing
      Distributes network traffic across multiple connections or servers
    
    Virtual LAN (VLAN) Support
      Allows logical segmentation of the network
    
    Port Forwarding
      Enables external access to specific services or devices on the internal network
    
    Remote Management
      Provides web-based or protocol-based administration and monitoring
    
    Logging and Monitoring
      Records network events and provides visibility into network activity
